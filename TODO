* provide short version for all command-line switches in all tools!
* analizo-metrics-history: try to remove dependency on grit
* remove all usage of shift when getting method arguments
  * use `my ($self, $arg1, $arg2) = @_;` instead
* fix the evolution matrix to do some sorting; display modules that appear earlier in the top
* do some marketing of the tool.
* refectoring: extract common behaviour from analizo-metrics-history and
  analizo-metrics-batch ("run analizo metrics against this batch of source code
  trees") and re-implement them in terms of that common behaviour.
