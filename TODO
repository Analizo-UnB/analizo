* write black-box tests for the old egypt script, using $whatever.
* rewrite the egypt script to use Egypt::Extractor and Egypt::Output::DOT. All
  black-box tests must pass.
* split Egypt::Output::DOT in two classes, one for actually generating the
  output and other for holding the design information. Actually most of the
  current Egypt::Output::DOT class seems to be about holding the design, not
  about generating output.
* do some marketing of the tool.
