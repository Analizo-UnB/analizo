* provide short version for all command-line switches in all tools!
* remove all usage of shift when getting method arguments
  * use `my ($self, $arg1, $arg2) = @_;` instead
* fix the evolution matrix to do some sorting; display modules that appear earlier in the top
* do some marketing of the tool.
* bash completion
* move away from ZeroMQ.

  "Please note that this module has been DEPRECATED in favor of ZMQ::LibZMQ2,
  ZMQ::LibZMQ3, and ZMQ. see https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ and other CPAN
  pages."

* use Digest::SHA instead of Digest::SHA1
